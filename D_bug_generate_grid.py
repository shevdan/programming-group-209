'''
This module contains functions that implements generation of the game grid.

Function level_of_dif determines the range (which is the representation
of the level of difficulty which that will be increased thorough the test)
from which the numbers will be taken.

Function generate_grid generates grid, with a one specific number of needed
type and 9 more random numbers.

    This function generates the game grid, which consist of 10 numbers.
